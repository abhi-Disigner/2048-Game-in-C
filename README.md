# 2048-Game-in-C
This project is a remake of the game – 2048; 2048 is a single-player sliding tile puzzle game. The objective of the game is to slide numbered tiles on a grid to combine them to create a tile with the number 2048. 

The whole project is developed in ‘C’ Programming language, different variables and strings have been used for the development of this project. It’s easy to operate and understood by users. It is easy to master. 

GAMEPLAY : 2048 is played on a plain 4×4 grid, with numbered tiles that slide when a player moves them using the four arrow keys. Every turn, a new tile randomly appears in an empty spot on the board with a value of either 2 or 4. Tiles slide as far as possible in the chosen direction until they are stopped by either another tile or the edge of the grid. If two tiles of the same number collide while moving, they will merge into a tile with the total value of the two tiles that collided. The resulting tile cannot merge with another tile again in the same move
